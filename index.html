    <h4>UX Designer</h4>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Joseph. I have a background in technical apparel design and am currently studying UX Design at UCLA Extension. I am using a Macbook Pro.

      Getting my local and hosting environments set up was a bit difficult, but I managed to make it to the end. The main issues I ran into was when connecting the repository and pushing the changes to the live host (I was getting errors). After updating xCode and git to the latest version, the errors went away and things began to work. After realizing which password the terminal was asking for when pushing to the host, it worked. Everything else went pretty smooth, just taking a lot longer then anticipated.
